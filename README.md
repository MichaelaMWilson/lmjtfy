# Let me Jira that for you - lmjtfy
### Like Let Me Google That For You, but for a Jira search instead.
Simply enter your Jira domain and search terms to generate a lmjtfy link.
Then, give the link to the recipient to have a search simulated and be redirected to Jira.

Note: This is a very simple application, made in a few hours for a joke. As such, this website may not be the most robust. Additonally, if your domain is not in the format https://jira.domain.com, it will not work.
